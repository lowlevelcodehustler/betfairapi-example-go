Example of a login and dummy function to the Betfair API

I wrote this since I didn't want to code in any of the languages Betfair provides as an example. It is supplied as-is and no warranties with regards to functionality are inferred. The code is supplied on a 'works for me' basis.

I am not affiliated with Betfair Paddy Power aside from being a customer and API user.

Enjoy.
